Our Android Application The Fourth Moosade™  is a text-based adventure that satires the Fourth Crusade. It has multiple humorous endings and well-crafted story paths.

This application was designed by Jared Martin and Brayden Pusser for the 2016-2017 Computer Coding Class at Trinity Christian Academy. Designed on Android Studio ver. 2.2.3, it is capable of fully utilizing the hardware and software of Android devices both old and new. This application was tested on a Nexus 5 Android Virtual Device.

The layout was designed to be simplistic and user-friendly, and will automatically scale to any screen size in portrait mode. Landscape mode is disabled. Each screen, with the exception of the title screen and the end screens, has a image (currently placeholder images), text pertaining to the current story path, and two options that bring you to the next screen. The title screen has the title, an image, a text box to enter one’s name, and a button to start the game. The end screens have an ending, an image, and a button to bring the player to the title screen.

We hope you enjoy our app, and if you have any technical difficulties, contact us at fake@email.com.
